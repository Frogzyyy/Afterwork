Afterwork is an Angular project for professionals and less professionals of hospitality industry, specifically chefs and bartender.
The idea is to share recipes, either dishes or cocktails.
As I've been a part of this industry, I'm leading this project knowing the client intents.
It is obviously open to all users, making everything clear and affordable with an axis of professional experience.
Because in a restaurant, work is all what we talk about Afterwork !
